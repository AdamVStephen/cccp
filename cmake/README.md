# Cmake Demos

Cmake is becoming the de-facto standard build tool.   This directory contains some example cmake scripting demonstrations.

## Conditional Build Types

The use case here is that for framework projects like MARTe, we need to build subsets of all of the code, and we
need to build for multiple different architectures.   A goal is to create a cmake stanza that will explain to the
user which subsets and platforms are supported and show how to make the builds appropriately.
